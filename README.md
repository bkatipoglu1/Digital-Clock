# Digital-Clock
Here is my first JavaScript project on GitHub !
There are some shortcomings in this project. For example ;
When the seconds , minutes or hours between 0 and 9 , the project have to write 01 , 02 ...
But writing 1, 2 , 3. For example the time is 23:03:45 , the project give an output something like 23:3:45 .
I haven't solved this problem yet. I am thinking of resolving and committing as soon as possible.
